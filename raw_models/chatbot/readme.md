# Gemini Bot - AI Chat & Analysis

## Overview
This Jupyter Notebook provides an interface to interact with Google's Gemini AI using the `google.generativeai` library. It allows users to:

- Set up and configure Gemini AI using an API key.
- Generate AI-driven text responses from the `gemini-2.0-flash` model.
- List available Gemini AI models.
- Use a function to **predict injury risks** based on player health and training data.

## Prerequisites
Before running the notebook, ensure you have the following installed:

```bash
pip install google-generativeai
```

Additionally, you need a **Gemini API key**, which can be obtained from Google AI's developer console.

## How to Use

### 1️⃣ Set Up API Key
Replace `YOUR_API_KEY_HERE` with your actual Gemini AI API key.

```python
import google.generativeai as genai

API_KEY = "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
genai.configure(api_key=API_KEY)
```

### 2️⃣ Generate AI Responses
You can interact with the AI using the `gemini-2.0-flash` model:

```python
model = genai.GenerativeModel("gemini-2.0-flash")
response = model.generate_content("Explain how AI works")
print(response.text)
```

### 3️⃣ List Available Models
To see which models are available:

```python
for model in genai.list_models():
    print(model.name)
```

### 4️⃣ Predict Injury Risk (Example Function)
The notebook includes a function to predict injury risks based on player data. Example usage:

```python
def predict_injury_risk(player_data):
    """
    Predicts the injury risk based on player's health and training data.
    Returns a risk assessment.
    """
    # Your AI model logic here
    pass
```

To use:

```python
player_info = {"heart_rate": 80, "fatigue": 5, "injury_history": True}
result = predict_injury_risk(player_info)
print(result)
```

## Notes
- The API key should be kept **private** and **not shared** in public repositories.
- Ensure that you comply with **Google AI's Terms of Service** while using the API.

## Future Enhancements
- Add a **web-based interface** using Flask or Streamlit.
- Improve the **injury risk prediction** function with real-world datasets.
- Implement **fine-tuning** using Google AI's latest models.
